        Text formatting is an important part of writing because it helps make information clear and easy to read. By using <b>bold text</b>, we can <mark> highlight </mark>the most important words or ideas in a paragraph. <i>Italic</i> formatting is useful when we want to <em>emphasize</em> something gently without making it <strong>too strong</strong>. Underlining can be used to draw attention to key points or important links. Highlighting helps readers quickly notice essential information. Good formatting also makes long paragraphs look neat and well-organized. Overall, text formatting improves understanding and keeps the reader engaged.
