<p> I am an aspiring <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> with a strong interest in building end-to-end web applications. I enjoy working with both <em>front-end</em> and <em>back-end</em> technologies, designing clean interfaces, and writing efficient server-side logic. </p> <p> My front-end skills include <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and modern frameworks like <em>React</em>. On the back end, I work with <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, and <strong>Python Flask</strong>, along with databases such as <strong>MongoDB</strong> and <strong>MySQL</strong>. </p> <p> I enjoy creating responsive layouts, API-based applications, and scalable architectures.
