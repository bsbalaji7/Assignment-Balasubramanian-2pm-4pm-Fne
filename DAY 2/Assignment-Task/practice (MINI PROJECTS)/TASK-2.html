        <center><h1>Emotion Detection from Text or Voice</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> Good evening everyone! I’m <strong>Bala</strong>, and today I am going to introduce my future project titled <strong><em>“Emotion Detection from Text or Voice”</em></strong> — an emerging area in <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> that enables machines to understand human emotions just like we do. </p> 

<p> The main objective of this project is to build a system that can automatically detect a person’s emotional state such as <strong>happy</strong>, <strong>sad</strong>, <strong>angry</strong>, or <strong>neutral</strong>, using their <em>speech (voice)</em> or <em>text input</em> through Python. </p>


<h2>Types of Emotion Detection</h2>

<p> Below are the two major types of emotion detection, with examples: </p>
 <p> <strong>1. Text-based Emotion Detection</strong><br> <em>Description:</em> Detects emotions from written text, messages, or chat.<br> <em>Example:</em> “I’m feeling so excited today!” → <strong>😊 Happy</strong> </p>
 
 <p> <strong>2. Voice-based Emotion Detection</strong><br> <em>Description:</em> Detects emotions from voice tone, pitch, pace, and energy.<br> <em>Example:</em> (Angry voice tone) → <strong>😠 Angry</strong> </p>


<h2>Main Purpose</h2>

<p> Emotion Detection helps computers understand human feelings such as <strong>happiness</strong>, <strong>sadness</strong>, <strong>stress</strong>, or <strong>anger</strong>. It creates a bridge between <em>human emotions</em> and <em>artificial intelligence</em>, making systems more interactive, intelligent, and human-like. </p>


<h2>Top Uses & Applications</h2>
<p> <strong>1. Customer Support (Chatbots & Call Centers)</strong><br> Detects angry or frustrated customers and routes them to a human agent.<br> <em>Example:</em> “I’m really upset” → Chatbot alerts support team. </p>

<p> <strong>2. Social Media Monitoring</strong><br> Analyzes public emotions in posts or comments to understand public opinion.<br> <em>Example:</em> Detecting negative reactions to a product launch. </p>
