<h1>About Antarctica</h1>

<p>
    Antarctica is the coldest and most remote continent on Earth, located at the southernmost part of the planet.
    It is covered almost entirely by thick ice and is home to unique wildlife such as penguins, seals, and whales.
    Although no one lives there permanently, scientists from different countries stay in research stations to study
    climate change, glaciers, and marine ecosystems. Antarctica plays a major role in regulating the Earth’s climate
    and sea levels, making it one of the most important yet mysterious places in the world.
