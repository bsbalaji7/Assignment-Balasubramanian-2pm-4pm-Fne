    <p>Leo (also marketed as Leo: Bloody Sweet) is a 2023 Indian Tamil-language action thriller film[7] directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. Produced by Seven Screen Studio, it is the third instalment in the Lokesh Cinematic Universe. Partially inspired by the David Cronenberg film A History of Violence, Leo stars Vijay in the titular role, alongside Sanjay Dutt, Arjun, Trisha, Gautham Vasudev Menon, Mysskin, Madonna Sebastian, George Maryan, Mansoor Ali Khan, Priya Anand and Mathew Thomas. In the film, Parthi, an outwardly humble man, draws the attention of gangsters Antony and Harold Das who insist he is Antony's son Leo, previously presumed dead.

The film was officially announced in January 2023 under the tentative title Thalapathy 67, as it is Vijay's 67th film as a lead actor, and the official title was announced a few days later. Principal photography commenced the same month in Chennai along with a sporadic schedule in Kashmir, which was again followed by another schedule held at the former location, and wrapped by mid-July. The film has music composed by Anirudh Ravichander, cinematography handled by Manoj Paramahamsa and editing by Philomin Raj.

Leo was released worldwide on 19 October 2023 in standard and IMAX formats to mixed reviews from critics, with praise for Vijay's performance, technical aspects and action sequences while the writing received criticism. It set several box office records for a Tamil film, emerging as the second highest-grossing Tamil film of 2023,[4][8][9][10] the seventh highest-grossing Indian film of 2023, third highest-grossing Tamil film of all time, the highest-grossing Tamil film overseas and the highest-grossing film in Tamil Nadu.[11]

Subramanian, president of the theatre owners’ association in Tamil Nadu, publicly stated that “Leo was not a profitable film for us” (theatre owners). The core problem, he claimed, was the high revenue share demanded by the film’s makers / distributors. The “Leo” case has become a spotlight example of how revenue-sharing negotiations can drastically impact theatre economics, regardless of how “successful” a film is claimed to be at the box office.

Plot
Parthiban "Parthi" is an outwardly humble wildlife rescuer and café proprietor living with his wife Sathya, son Siddharth "Siddhu" and daughter Mathi "Chintu" in Theog, Himachal Pradesh. One day, his forest ranger friend Joshy Andrews seeks his help in taming a spotted hyena creating chaos; Parthi tames the hyena with the help of Siddhu and adopts it subsequently, but chooses to avoid media coverage. Meanwhile, a group of merciless burglars headed by Shanmugham threaten the townsfolk and intrude Parthi's café at its closing time. When they intimidate Parthi with the lives of Chintu and his employee Shruthi, he shoots them dead. Parthi is arrested, but acquitted after the killings are concluded to be in self-defense.

After surviving an assassination attempt by Shanmugham's brother-in-law, Parthi appeals for a Tamil-speaking police officer to protect him and his family. Napoleon, who has been promoted due to his heroics in Tiruchirappalli,[a] is assigned that position. Meanwhile, owing to the incident, Parthi's photographs appear in newspapers nationwide and draw the attention of Telangana-based drug baron brothers Harold and Antony Das. Antony promptly leaves for Theog, having recognised Parthi to be his thought-to-be-dead son Leo; Parthi, nevertheless, fiercely denies his claims. Disbelieving Parthi, Antony meets Sathya and tells her that Parthi is his son Leo, an infamous criminal. Suspicious, Sathya and Joshy separately investigate Parthi's past. While Sathya meets Parthi's childhood friend, Joshy meets Leo's friend Hridayaraj D'Souza, a soon-to-be-executed convict, who narrates Leo's alleged past.[b]

In 1999, after Harold returns to India upon completing his education in Canada, he begins manufacturing and selling a stimulant drug named Datura, using Antony's failing tobacco factory Das & Co as a front organization. Antony's twin children Leo and Elisa assist the brothers in their activities. Antony is also a staunch believer of occult practices and engages in human sacrifices to succour their business. During a celebration, Antony is told by an occult priest that sacrificing one of his children will grant him enormous success; he chooses Elisa and urges Leo to cooperate but he strongly resists and fights Antony and Harold. In the process, he sets the drugs on fire but fails to protect Elisa from getting killed by Harold. She pleads with him to abandon the business and lead a peaceful life, before dying. Leo is shot by Antony and presumed dead.

Joshy and Sathya are convinced that Leo and Parthi are not the same. Parthi discerns that Sathya is suspecting his identity and confronts her but they eventually reconcile. Antony informs Parthi that he has kidnapped Siddhu and that he is going to be sacrificed. Parthi and Napoleon give chase to Antony and his men; Parthi successfully subdues them and kills Antony but does not find Siddhu, who is revealed to have been held captive by Harold at Das & Co.

After Harold agrees to return Siddhu in exchange for Antony's corpse, Parthi takes the latter alone to Das & Co, but realises that Harold has double-crossed him by sending henchmen to murder Sathya and Chintu. While Joshy, Napoleon and the hyena protect Sathya and Chintu by killing the henchmen, Parthi fights Harold and subsequently holds him at gunpoint. Harold finally agrees that Parthi is not Leo and assures no harm to him and his family. Parthi laughs loudly and confirms he is Leo before shooting Harold dead and rescuing Siddhu. While torching Das & Co, Parthi asserts that he has done nothing good to be remembered as Leo and that anyone who knows his identity must die or already be dead, recalling that he admitted the truth to Antony before killing him.

While back in Theog, Parthi receives a phone call. The anonymous caller[c] tells him that he knows his true identity and contends that destroying his family's factory will not make society drug-free, imploring him to join his mission and correctly surmises that Parthi might have recognised him by now, following which he sighs in exasperation.</p>
