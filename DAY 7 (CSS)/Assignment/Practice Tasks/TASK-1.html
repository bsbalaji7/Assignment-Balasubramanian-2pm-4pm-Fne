    <h1>PARA 1</h1>
        <p style="color: red;">Technology has transformed education by making learning more accessible and flexible. Students can now learn from anywhere through online classes, digital textbooks, and educational videos. This has especially benefited learners in remote areas, allowing them to access the same quality of information as students in major cities. Tools like learning apps and virtual classrooms have removed many traditional barriers to education.</p>
    
        <h2>PARA 2</h2>
            <p class="p2">Another major impact is personalized learning. With the help of AI-based platforms, students can learn at their own pace, receive instant feedback, and review difficult topics as many times as they need. Teachers can also use digital tools to track student performance and understand their strengths and weaknesses. This makes the learning process more engaging and effective.</p>
        
        <h3>PARA 3</h3>
            <p class="p3">However, technology also brings some challenges. Not all students have equal access to devices or the internet, creating a digital divide. Excessive screen time may affect concentration, and relying too much on technology can reduce face-to-face social interaction. Despite these issues, technology continues to play a crucial role in shaping modern education, making it more innovative, interactive, and student-centered.</p>
